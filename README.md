# SBSAnimojiRecording

Shows how Apples Animojis can be overlayed on a camera feed using ARKit. **NB: This is achieved in a hacky way.**

Videos are recorded using ReplayKit.

# Notice

This project relies heavily on Apples private API and you should therefore not try to submit this code to App Store.
